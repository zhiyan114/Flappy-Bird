# Flappy Bird
A Flappy Bird clone game with custom cosmetics.

# How to build
Currently, the only way to obtain any builds is if I build them and publish it as release tag. It is recommended to play the version that you build as any small patches and feature update will not result in creating new tag.

Although you can use any versions/editions, it recommended that you use the following version of unity since those are the ones that are used to make this game.
* License Type: `Pro`
* Version: `2021.2.7f1`

If you're unable to build for any reason, feel free to use the WebGL pre-build version here: https://flapbird.furries.video/ (Download desktop edition for the most compatibility).
